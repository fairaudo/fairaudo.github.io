Default only affects sophisticated bond traders, whereas inflation concerns a larger and less informed group. Within a two-period Bayesian trading game, differential information manifests itself in the secondary market, and we display conditions under which debt prices are more resilient to bad news even in the primary market, where only sophisticated players operate. Our results can explain debt prices across countries following the 2008 financial crisis, and also provide a theory of “original sin.”","tags":["Expectations","Speculations","International Lending and Debt Problems","National Debt","Debt Management","Sovereign Debt"],"title":"Is Inflation Default?
