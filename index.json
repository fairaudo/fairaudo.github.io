We study green transitional dynamics. Permanent increases in brown energy prices induce a green transition with short run inflation and persistent output losses. Fiscal policy impacts the transition. Brown energy taxes are inflationary and crowd out brown energy use in favor of green energy. Green public investment or green subsidies have moderate macroeconomic effects, but do not crowd out brown energy use. We discuss fiscal costs and evaluate welfare along the green transition using different metrics.","tags":["Fiscal and Monetary Policy","Energy Economics","Green Transition","Small open economies"],"title":"The green metamorphosis of a small open economy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florencia S.

As the economies recover and inflation far exceeds the target, central banks face a challenge in how to manage their balance sheet. I study the macroeconomic effects of reducing the central bank balance sheet size, i.e., Quantitative Tightening (QT). I construct a Regime-Switching New Keynesian DSGE model calibrated to the US economy. The economy fluctuates between a monetary-led regime, a fiscally-led regime, and the zero lower bound on the monetary policy interest rate. The macroeconomic effects of QT crucially depend on the fiscal-monetary policy mix. In a monetary-led regime, QT effectively reduces inflation at the cost of increasing the government debt-to-GDP ratio. In contrast, unwinding the central bank balance sheet in a fiscally-led regime has little impact on inflation. The negative demand effect driven by QT is not enough to counteract the stimulative impact of negative real interest rates and fiscal stimulus.","tags":["Quantitative Easing","Quantitative Tightening","Fiscal and Monetary policy mix","Markov Switching"],"title":"Exit strategies from Quantitative Easing: the role of the fiscal-monetary policy mix","type":"job_market_paper"},{"authors":["Florencia S.

We consider a canonical real business cycle small open economy model with sovereign default, where the default choice is driven by fundamentals and a stochastic utility cost of default. We show that the model is isomorphic to an endogenous regime-switching model. Our solution method is both fast and accurate. We estimate the model using likelihood methods and time-series data for Argentina to decompose the main drivers of the interest rate spread in normal times and around a sovereign debt crisis. Our fully micro-founded approach also allows us to conduct policy counterfactuals.

We develop a theory that links long-run growth, financial frictions, and Sudden Stops in Emerging countries. Our theory exploits the fact that reversals in trade balance during Sudden Stops occur through sharp declines in imports, particularly of imported investment, rather than increases in exports. Imported investment, in turn, has a permanent impact on economic growth. We find that trend growth deteriorates during Sudden Stops and, even though trend shocks play a crucial role, financial frictions and shocks have a significant impact on its dynamics. We apply our model to the Sudden Stops in Argentina since the 1950s and find that financial crises have a strong permanent effect on the trend. Hence, to a large extent, the trend is the cycle.","tags":["Emerging Markets","Real Business Cycle","Trend Shocks","Financial Frictions"],"title":"The Trend-Cycle connection","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586131200,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://fairaudo.github.io/research/","publishdate":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Research Page","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586131200,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"https://fairaudo.github.io/teaching/","publishdate":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"Teaching summary","tags":null,"title":"Teaching Page","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://fairaudo.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
